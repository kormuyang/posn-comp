# POSN Computer

Hi everyone! This repo was intentionally made as a guideline for competing in POSN Computer.

## Roadmap

1. Learn the language (C/C++)
2. Understand Analysis of Algorithms
3. [Learn the concept of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)](#curriculum-dsa)

## Curriculum: DSA

This is the most significant part because DSA is the main concept taught in the camp.
